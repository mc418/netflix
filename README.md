This project built a netflix-like web app with React and Redux, used local JSON file as mock backend data

To run the app, clone this repo and run: npm start

In this app, there are 2 rows: My List and Recommendation, each row displays several shows poster. On the bottom of the page, there's a title list of My List.

This app has 2 basic actions, remove cur show from MY_LIST and move it to RECOMMENDATIONS, and add show from RECOMMENDATIONS to MY_LIST. The title of the show would show up when mouse hover on the poster, and certain button would be clickable at the same time.
